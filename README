Dependencies
============
- Reasonably compliant C++ compiler (gcc 3.x, vc 7.1, etc)
- Boost library: See www.boost.org for details and downloads
- CppUnit (optional for test suite): See cppunit.sf.net
- (optional) SConsAddons - Addon library for the build system.  https://realityforge.vrsource.org/SconsAddons

Building
========
CppDom uses the scons build system.  You can download scons from www.scons.org.

We also use the SconsAddons library (see above).  It is included in the source
tree or you can add its source directory in your PYTHONPATH to build.

ex: https://realityforge.vrsource.org/svn/scons-addons/trunk/scons-addons

PYTHONPATH=/home/username/scons-addons/src

NOTE: In the future we hope to use third party branches or svn:externals to 
remove the need to download this separately.

Once you have both of these, the follow steps should be all you need.

Please see 'scons --help' for a list of options for specifying where the
dependencies are located.

type 'scons' to build cppdom shared lib.
type 'scons install' to install on the system
type 'scons install prefix=$HOME/software' to install in your account

Universal Binaries
==================

To build the CppDOM libraries as univeral binaries (Mac OS X only), use the
following command:

   scons darwin_universal=yes var_arch=universal var_type=optimized

This will default to using the Mac OS X 10.4 universal SDK in
/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4.u.sdk. To override this, add the following
option to the above command line:

   darwin_sdk=/path/to/platform/sdk
