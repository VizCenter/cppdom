Dependencies
============
- Reasonably compliant C++ compiler (gcc 3.x, vc 7.1, etc)
- Boost library: See www.boost.org for details and downloads
- CppUnit (optional for test suite): See cppunit.sf.net
- SConsAddons - Addon library for the build system.  https://realityforge.vrsource.org/SconsAddons

Building on Windows
===================
To build CppDOM for 32-bit Windows using either Visual Studio .NET 2002 or
Visual Studio .NET 2003, open the file vc7\cppdom.sln using Visual Studio.
Build the desired targets (usually "Debug - DLL" and "Release - DLL"). The
compiled files will be in the 'lib' subdirectory of the source tree.

Using Visual Studio 2005, either 32-bit Windows or 64-bit Windows (x64 only)
can be targetd. Open the file vc8\cppdom.sln using Visual Studio 2005, and
build the desired targets (usually "Debug - DLL" and "Release - DLL") for the
desired platforms ("Win32" and/or "x64"). The compiled files will be in the
'lib' subdirectory of the source tree in one or both of the directories
'win32' (for the 32-bit build) and 'x64' (for the 64-bit build).

Installation must be performed by hand.  The following commands show a
possible way to install everything correctly:

   mkdir C:\cppdom\include\cppdom
   mkdir C:\cppdom\include\cppdom\ext
   mkdir C:\cppdom\lib
   copy cppdom\*.h C:\cppdom\include\cppdom
   copy cppdom\ext\*.h C:\cppdom\include\cppdom\ext
   copy lib\*.lib C:\cppdom\lib
   copy lib\*.dll C:\cppdom\lib

If the build was performed using Visual Studio 2005, then the last two
commands above would instead be the following (32-bit only):

   copy lib\win32\*.lib C:\cppdom\lib
   copy lib\win32\*.dll C:\cppdom\lib

or (64-bit only):

   copy lib\x64\*.lib C:\cppdom\lib
   copy lib\x64\*.dll C:\cppdom\lib

or (32-bit and 64-bit):

   copy lib\win32\*.lib C:\cppdom\lib\win32
   copy lib\win32\*.dll C:\cppdom\lib\win32
   copy lib\x64\*.lib C:\cppdom\lib\x64
   copy lib\x64\*.dll C:\cppdom\lib\x64

NOTE: Compiling the OPTIONAL Spirit-based parser (see cppdom\SpiritParser.cpp)
is not currently supported by either of the Visual Studio solutions.

Building
========
CppDom uses the scons build system.  You can download scons from www.scons.org.

We also use the SconsAddons library (see above).  You will need its source 
directory in your PYTHONPATH to build.

ex: https://realityforge.vrsource.org/svn/scons-addons/trunk/scons-addons

PYTHONPATH=/home/username/scons-addons/src

NOTE: In the future we hope to use third party branches or svn:externals to 
remove the need to download this separately.

Once you have both of these, the follow steps should be all you need.

Please see 'scons --help' for a list of options for specifying where the
dependencies are located.

type 'scons' to build cppdom shared lib.
type 'scons install' to install on the system
type 'scons install prefix=$HOME/software' to install in your account
